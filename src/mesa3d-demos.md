# On becoming a better OpenGL and Vulkan developer...

As part of my effort to become a better OpenGL and Vulkan developer, as well as to delve deeper into system programming, I intend to go over each of the Mesa3D demos, present at their official repository.

If I happen to stumble upon some possible improvement or fix, I will (and already have) submit merge requests to the project.

Watch this space if you want to read me learning what should have been obvious to me for the last 20 years (I've been dabling with OpenGL since the late 90s!)
